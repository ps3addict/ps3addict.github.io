# Using Safe Mode (Recovery)​

You will have to use a USB wire with your controller in Safe Mode (even if it is a wireless controller). Some non-Sony controllers will not work while in safe mode.

## To enter Safe Mode:

1. Begin with the PS3 turned off. The power light should be red.
2. Press and hold the power button untill the PS3 beeps three times and shuts down again. The power light should be red again.
3. Press and hold the power button again. You will hear a beep, then another beep, then a double beep. Let go of the power button after the double beep.

(If your PS3 can not beep due to broken speaker, the power light also flashs when the PS3 beeps.)

## Safe Mode Options:

1. Restart System -- This will exit Safe Mode and boot the PS3 normally.

2. Resore Default Settings -- <font color="red">​This will DELETE all PSN data!</font> It will also reset all System Settings to default values.

3. Resore File System -- This will attempt to fix file problems. It may take a while to complete.

4. Rebuild Database -- This will attempt to fix database problems. It will DELETE messages, playlists, video playback resume info, and maybe other info. It may take a while to complete.

5. Resore PS3 System -- <font color="red">​This will FORMAT the PS3 hard drive! ALL DATA WILL BE DELETED!</font>

6. System Update -- Use this option to install System Updates (PS3UPDAT.PUP).
