Can my Playstation 3 be hacked?

All Playstation 3 models can be hacked.

<details>

<summary>There are two hacks available.</summary>
The first is Custom Firmware (CFW). This is the oldest hack. It patches system files permanently and becomes part of the PS3's operating system software. The Second is PS3Xploit's Homebrew ENabler (HEN). It must be enabled by the user everytime they start the PS3.
